# Corner-Grocer

Project Summary:
The Corner Grocer Application is a C++ program designed to manage and analyze item frequency data for a grocery store. The program reads data from an input file, populates a map with item frequencies, and provides a menu-driven interface for users to query and visualize this data. The problem it solves is efficiently tracking and presenting the frequency of items in the store.

Achievements:
The program effectively utilizes a map to store and manipulate item frequencies. The menu-driven interface enhances user experience, allowing easy access to various functionalities like searching for a specific item's frequency, displaying all items' frequencies, and visualizing a histogram. The code is modular, with functions dedicated to specific tasks, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Areas for Enhancement:
While the program serves its purpose, improvements can be made for efficiency and security. Error handling during file operations and input validation could be implemented to enhance robustness. Additionally, incorporating exception handling would make the code more resilient. Clearer comments and documentation would also aid understanding and future modifications.

Challenges and Solutions:
The most challenging aspect was implementing a clear screen function compatible with both Windows and Unix-like systems. The clearScreen() function uses system commands ("cls" for Windows and "clear" for Unix-like systems) to achieve this. Overcoming this challenge involved researching and implementing platform-specific solutions, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Transferable Skills:
Skills developed in this project, including file handling, map data structures, and creating modular programs with a clear user interface, are highly transferable. Understanding how to navigate platform differences for system commands adds to the adaptability of the code. These skills can be applied to various projects involving data processing and user interactions.

Maintainability and Readability:
The code prioritizes maintainability, readability, and adaptability. Meaningful function names and comments explain each section's purpose. The modular structure allows for easier debugging and future modifications. The inclusion of a saveDataToFile() function ensures data persistence, promoting long-term maintainability. Overall, the code is designed with clarity and ease of comprehension in mind.
